# Python_SS_2018
Introduction to Python SS 2018 University Bonn 

Materials for the course 'Introduction to Python (Scientific Programming with Python)' (Summer Term 2018)

## Goal of the course
The goal of the course is to teach master physics-students how to efficiently 
and flexibly solve scientific programming problems with the easy-to-learn, 
high-level programming language Python. The course specifically addresses 
students with no prior programming experience.

## Where and when?
 - Where: Physics CIP-Pool; AVZ I Endenicher Alle 11-13 Room 1.008 (1st floor)
 - When: 8:00 am s.t. - 11:00 am on each Friday (except public holidays) in the 2018 Summer Term

## Preconditions for the course
I assume familiarity with the *Linux* operating system, especially using the
*Unix*-command line.

## Computer / Laptop setup
Each student will work actively with an own computer in the Physics CIP-Pool. All necessary software is already installed on the computers. For those, who would like to setup own computers/laptops with the proper software, I provide necessary information [here](https://github.com/ocordes/Python_SS_2018/tree/master/computer_setup).
